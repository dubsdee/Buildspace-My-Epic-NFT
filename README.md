# Basic NFT Minting Contract

Hi! Thanks for checking out my GitHub. 

This project is a basic NFT minting exercise based on the Buildspace Epic NFT walkthrough. 

Some of the things that were done included:
    - Putting together a React front-end site with Replit. Check it out:
        - https://nft-starter-project.dsreplit.repl.co/

    - Setting up some themed dynamic arrays that generate random text for each mint

    - Introduced some SVG/JSON encoding to get our images on-chain (still rusty on how this works, need to refresh but it works!)

    - Deploying the contract to Alchemy

    - You can check out the collection on the OpenSea Rinkeyby testnet here:
        - https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/dragonballnft-hnu44i1phc

Some additional things left to do to clean it up - 

1. Check the code for the total minted counter - it seems to work and display the total minted only after you interact with the contract. Says 0 minted so far otherwise which is wrong!

2. For some reason, the OpenSea link displays some weird text in the page title - I'm not sure where thats coming from but should be checked out.
